How to install guide: https://medium.com/@ajstorm/installing-db2-on-your-coffee-break-5be1d811b052

1) run in CLI
docker run -itd --name db2 -e DBNAME=testdb -v ~/:/database -e DB2INST1_PASSWORD=MASter15 -e LICENSE=accept -p 50000:50000 --privileged=true ibmcom/db2

You can follow along with what’s going on after the install using the command:
docker logs db2

Creates a database named testdb
Mounts ~/ into the container as /database which is where it will create the testdb database (NOTE: if you’re interested in placing your database in a different location — which is probably advisable — just substitute ~/ with some other location. Of course, on Windows you’ll need to substitute this with a Windows friendly path.)
Sets the db2inst1 user password set to GD10JfLGG64HV2dtwK (Please change this password to something secure of your choosing)
Automatically accepts the user licence
Sets the Db2 ports to 50000 inside the container, and maps it to port 50000 outside of the container. If you’d like a different port outside of the container, feel free to change the first 50000.
Starts the container in privileged mode

2) docker logs db2

3)
Once the install has completed you can get into the container to run the Db2 CLP using the following command to access container shell:
docker exec -it db2 bash -c "su db2inst1"

create new image from container - docker commit <container id> device:11.1
